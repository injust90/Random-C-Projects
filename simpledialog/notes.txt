Library game
Go through the terminal, discover a new language.

Quizzer:
- Player is asked what character it is, and inputs the romaji
- Implement a randomizer

Randomizer subroutine returns a random カタカナ character
	store an array of katakana characters
	randomly select with random

Main routine
first get a random character to test the player
	then compare that character to the romaji inputted
	give player a score of correct answers
if we see character

character\n
\n telling the loop to loop again c = getwchar

アイウエオ
it will run the while loop multiple times

aiueo\n

while len = getline(line, MAXLINE) > 0
	if length of line is equal to 1
		check line[0] against katakana
		if input is correct
			print correct
	else
		print incorrect
	
Right now the issue (I think) is that the input is one behind the tester.

Maybe use the regular while loop?

カ(ka)
user: ka

Do we compare by position in the strings?
a i u e o
アイウエオ

can we return the position of the character for use in comparing?

if we see a, return the position of the string of the katakana
compare that position to the position of the romaji

randomChar() give me position of ア
if a == romaji.position


Mechanics
- Checker that checks for random characters
- Type out text

Let me introduce you to the first character
The character is vocalized "a" like "ahh"
